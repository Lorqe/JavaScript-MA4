1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the Document Object Model. This is kind of like the "final" HTML for a document.
This is represented so that we can manipulate it with different methods, like JavaScript.

It's the programming interface for HTML or XML. 

2. List three methods to manipulate the DOM.
createElement()
appendChild()
addEventListener()

3. What is an asynchronous call?
Normally a code will run from top to bottom, where only one thing happens at once.
If one function relies on information from another everything has to wait for that result to come then execute the rest.
With Asynchrounous call you can run this code at the same time as other code.

4. Briefly explain what the sources tab in Chrome Developers Tools does.
The sources tab in Chrome lets u see many of the files/documents that are on the "server", or that is connected to the file you are on.

html document.
